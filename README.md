# Nterm

A library that makes developing games for the terminal easier by providing a canvas-like interface for optimised drawing to the terminal, and captures and handles key presses, releases, and holds.
This library is currently being developed solely to support [Budget Tetris](https://github.com/Zemogus/Budget-Tetris), but may be used as a standalone library as well.
